## Code thats been used in the IDATG2206 Computer Vision course at NTNU.

### Disclaimer
This code should probably not be used for anything where you need it to work! 

It's single use, don't be surprised if something brakes after using it one time.
If you as much as think about changing a single character it will probably break.
There is no proper testing and there is no error handling.
I take no responsibility for anything related to the code.

Other than that, feel free to use the code.
